## Translation Notes

The article maintains consistent terminology between English and Chinese versions:
- "Classicalization" = "经典化"
- "Quantum superposition" = "量子叠加态"
- "Observer" = "观察者"
- "Dimension" = "维度"
- "Entropy" = "熵"
- "Phase transition" = "相变"

Mathematical notation is preserved identically in both language versions.
